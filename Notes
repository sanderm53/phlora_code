To export to other devices:

0. Add the device ID of the target iPad in MJS Apple developer account

1. Make sure all Xcode 9.2 signing settings are set to Automatic, and iOS Developer

2. In Xcode select /Products/Archive to create the directory with the .ipa archive file
(Takes a while!).

3. Copy this to your target Mac laptop or desktop and open Apple Configurator 2 (from AppStore)

4. Plug in iPad to target Mac laptop, select device when it is shown and click + to add the .ipa file, etc.

5. Should install and run. 




To upload to iTunesConnect:

-- I think I did the export with the iPad pro attached and selected as the target!!!!!!
-- Have to increment the build version number in XCODE's info.plist pane. Specifically the
bundle versions string, short.
-- Then go to Product/Archive in XCode to start upload process.
-- Click upload to app store
-- Choose default various options about bitcode and symbols, and default autosigning etc
-- Click upload to app store
